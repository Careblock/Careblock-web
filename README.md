# CareBlock Web

**CareBlock** is a decentralized Electronic Health Record (EHR) system that leverages blockchain technology to give patients ownership, transparency, and easy access to their medical data across different healthcare providers.

This repository contains the **frontend web application** of the CareBlock project, funded by Project Catalyst.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite  
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core  
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server  
- **Blockchain Integration:** Web3j (Java-based Ethereum library)

## 🚀 Project Overview

CareBlock aims to transform how health records are managed by:

- Giving patients a secure and immutable medical history.
- Enabling seamless access and sharing of data across healthcare facilities.
- Leveraging blockchain to ensure authentication, privacy, accountability, and interoperability.
- Designing modular architecture to support integration with existing healthcare systems.

The system also incentivizes medical stakeholders (e.g., researchers, public health authorities) to participate as network "miners" who maintain the blockchain and receive anonymized health data as rewards under a Proof of Work consensus.
